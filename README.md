# Pairs Trading Strategy with Machine Learning (KNN)
This project implements a pairs trading strategy integrated with machine learning using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Developed as part of an internship at Deepscope, the strategy aims to identify cointegrated pairs of financial instruments and use KNN to predict price movements for more effective trading decisions.

### Features
- Pairs Trading Strategy: Implements a statistical arbitrage strategy based on the correlation between two financial instruments.
- Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict future price movements based on historical data.
- Data Collection: Fetches historical financial data using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
- Signal Generation: Generates trading signals based on the price relationships between the identified pairs.
- Backtesting: Includes a backtesting module to evaluate the strategy's performance over historical data.
- Real-time Predictions: Uses KNN to make real-time predictions for entry and exit points.
